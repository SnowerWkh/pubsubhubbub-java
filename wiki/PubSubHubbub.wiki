===Overview===

[http://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/ PubSubHubbub] is an open protocol for distributed Publish/subscribe communication on the internet. The protocol extends the [http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4287.txt Atom] and RSS protocols for data feeds. The main purpose is to provide near-instant notifications of change updates, which would improve on the typical situation where a client periodically polls the feed server at some arbitrary interval.

You can find more information of the project in the [http://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/ PubSubHubbub Google site] 

===Implementation===

PubSubHubbub-java currently implements the client portion of pubsubhubbub publisher mechanism in java. Other parts of the protocol are being worked on.
